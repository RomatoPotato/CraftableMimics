This mod allows you to create an item for the summons of wooden, gold, shadow or ice mimics.

Wooden mimics can be summoned to the surface
Golden mimics can be summoned in the dungeon
Shadow mimics can be called in hell
Ice mimic can only be summoned in caves of ice biome

To do this, create a Mysterious key from
- ten souls of night
- ten soul of light
- 10 of any wood
- 2 gold or platinum bars
- 10 obsidian
- 10 ice blocks

Thanks for using my first mod! ;)
